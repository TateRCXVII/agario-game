# Comments to Evaluators:
The FileLogging in theory works. We weren't sure how to inject it into our networking or other classes.

# Time Estimate vs. Actual Breakdown
*estimate*: 3
*actual*: 5 - we thought that with the lab it'd be easier to implement this. But, given all the specificities of the custom logger,
it was tough to adapt the code on such a fresh topic as dependency injection.

# Assignment Specific Topics

### ShowTimeAndThread
This extension works.

### CustomFileLogProvider
This class should work as an extension to the file logger and log to the file.

### CustomFileLogger
Class functions as tested.
