# Comments to Evaluators:
The FileLogging in theory works. We weren't sure how to inject it into our networking or other classes.

# Assignment Specific Topics

### ShowTimeAndThread
This extension works.

### CustomFileLogProvider
This class should work as an extension to the file logger and log to the file.

### CustomFileLogger
Class functions as tested.
