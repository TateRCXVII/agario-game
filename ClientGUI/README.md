# Description:
This project is the GUI and accompanying code for running the Agario game on a desktop. The GUI is simple and follows the design of the example project and 
functions as expected. It allows the user to connect to a server, eat food, split, and play with other players.

# Notes:
Our FPS for some reason hovers at 20 and sometimes increases. This could be a flaw in the math, or it could be because our Zoom sessions slows the code down.
This represents our own work.
